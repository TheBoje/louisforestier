### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Louis Forestier, aka Ghalaodh#1086 on Discord.

I'm a first year student in a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I'm looking to specialize in graphic programming. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Graphic programming.
I already have some knowledge in OpenGL and I'm getting my first hands on Vulkan.
I am also interested in VR and AR. I was able to develop some Virtual Reality applications on Unity for MetaQuest 2, I would now like to discover augmented reality.
